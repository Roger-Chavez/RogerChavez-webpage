    <h1>Body for Assignment 1</h1>
    <p>
      I'm currently in a <strong> game engine programming class </strong> and
      find all that stuff very intersting. Worked with physics objects all that
      is pretty complicated as it is but was made even more complicated by the
      fact that there was no way to view any of the physics objects which isn't
      an issue on most modern game engines, but since my course uses a custom
      game engine and they didn't implement a way to debug the physics engine we
      struggled a little more than we should have because we couldn't view if we
      were placing the physics objects correctly.
